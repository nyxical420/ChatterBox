# ChatterBox
A simple chatting software!

## Notes
Things to note before you start using ChatterBox:

1. I don't recommend using this to talk about anything private or serious at all, even when you talk to a Random ChatterBox Server. as they have Logs to everything unless you trust the owner of the ChatterBox Server your using.

2. Your ChatterBox ID is based on your Public IP Address which is encrypted in base64 and base16, and the lines split to prevent anyone trying to track you down. I made this so you have a permanent-ish ChatterBox ID to use. Recommended to use [Cloudflare WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) if you dont want your IP to be used as an ChatterBox ID.

3. This was made for a School Project made by myself, I will or will not update this once i submit and showcase this to my class, depends if i like this project as others or not.

4. ChatterBox Servers are hosted in [ekzhang/bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore) to expose your locally hosted ChatterBox Server to the internet and let people connect to your server.

5. When hosting a server, do not use [Cloudflare WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) or else you wont be able to tunnel your server in public.

## ChatterBox Requirements
- 64-bit Compatible Processor to run Bore and ChatterBox.
- 2.00GHz Intel/AMD Processor for handling message logs.
